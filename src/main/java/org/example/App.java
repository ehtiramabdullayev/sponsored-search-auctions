         * Hello, fellow engineer who'll read this!
         * I've tried to read the document and tried to understand the whole concept,
         * but my lack of knowledge in the sphere of economics made it very hard for me to understand
         * the concept that has been asked, but i tried to take the main functionality of bidding
         * which i understood from the doc is placing the bids for the slot and deciding who wins it (the highest bidder wins)
         *
         *
         * so feel free to check my tests, i was able to cover very little but i hope i named them well enough so you can
         * understand what i did there.
         *
         * I didn't have time to implement proper error handling, imports might have wildcards, couldn't have time to write well
         * input validation, methods can be even separated to smaller methods, it's not good enough for multithreaded environment and so on
         *
         * Have fun reviewing it!
         * */
